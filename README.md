## Explanation of each State Management
- [context](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/useContext) - React Context API (useContext)
> This is a built-in way to share data between components without passing props down multiple levels. It is lightweight and easy to use, making it a great option for smaller projects.
### How to use
```javascript
// Context.js
import React from 'react';

const UserContext = React.createContext();

export default UserContext;

// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import UserContext from './Context';

function App() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: 'John Doe' });

  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={{ user, setUser }}>
      <Main />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
}

// Main.js
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import UserContext from './Context';

function Main() {
  const { user, setUser } = useContext(UserContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {user.name}!</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setUser({ name: 'Jane Doe' })}>
        Change Name
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

```
- [redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) - Predictable State Container for JavaScript Apps
> This is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps that helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.
### How to use
```javascript
// actions.js
export const updateUser = (user) => ({
  type: 'UPDATE_USER',
  user,
});

// reducer.js
export default function userReducer(state = { name: 'John Doe' }, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'UPDATE_USER':
      return action.user;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

// store.js
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import userReducer from './reducer';

const store = createStore(userReducer);

export default store;

// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { updateUser } from './actions';

function App({ user, updateUser }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {user.name}!</h1>
      <button onClick={() => updateUser({ name: 'Jane Doe' })}>
        Change Name
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  user: state,
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  updateUser: (user) => dispatch(updateUser(user)),
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(App);
